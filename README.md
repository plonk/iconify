# Iconify

Iconify is a utility program to turn a command line into a status
icon.

## Installation

    $ gem install iconify

## Usage

With the following, a bash instance will be started and a status icon
with the label 'bash' on it will appear on your notification area.

    $ iconify bash

Click on the icon and a terminal window appears in which the process
is running. When you close the window, it will only be hidden from
view and a subsequent click on the status icon will bring it back
again.
